This study showed that thermal band's impact on machine learning model results is not very strong overall and quantifying its importance needs more in-depth approach.
The land cover map was created from imagery of only one 16-day interval and its accuracy was rather average, especially when compared with state-of-the-art works in this field [@malinowski_automated_2020; @witjes_spatiotemporal_2021].
On the other hand, obtained results were accurate enough to apply methods of measuring variable importance and to make some conclusions from findings of this analysis.

Variable importance was evaluated using several methods such as permutation-based computation, break-down plots, Shapley values and partial-dependence profiles ([@sec-importance]).
All these approaches gave similar outcomes - thermal band had low impact on general results of the created model.
Inclusion of thermal band increased overall performance measures by a very narrow margin (less than 1%), which is not as optimistic outcome as in other studies focused on this issue [@rodriguez-galiano_incorporating_2012; @sun_improvement_2015; @zhao_exploring_2019].

However, more in-depth analysis revealed that land surface temperature had greater impact on predicting artificial land than any other land cover class.
In order to add spatial context to the importance values, two methods of creating variable importance maps were developed.
The first method applied points interpolation, while the second one used raster aggregation and averaged spectral values.
After analysis of the created maps, it became clear that thermal band was more influential in classifying urban areas than for rest of the classes, although its importance was mostly correlated with land cover type.
Clear spatial-autocorrelation of thermal band's importance was not detected, probably because of too sparsely distributed training points.
Above method should be further examined and tested, since studying spatial distribution of variable importance could improve our understanding of different variables' impact on machine learning model results or may provide new knowledge in this topic.

Findings of this study suggest that thermal band could help in mapping the development of cities and urban areas.
Its inclusion may help distinguish artificial land from other similar land cover types.
More accurate land cover maps will help in better growth management of metropolitan areas and in quantifying impact of urbanization on natural environment more precisely.
Nonetheless, further research should be carried out on bigger area and for larger number of satellite images.
It is crucial to extend this study to include spatio-temporal aspect of imagery, in order to investigate thermal band's impact on model predictions throughout different vegetation seasons.
Moreover, areas from different climate zones should be examined with an emphasis on the thermal band importance issue.
Newly launched Landsat 9 satellite can also provide improvement for thermal band's use for land cover mapping, because its Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS-2) is expected to perform better in Earth observation than its predecessor - TIRS sensor from Landsat 8.
