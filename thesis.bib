	abstract = {Abstract
          A seamless spatiotemporal machine learning framework for automated prediction, uncertainty assessment, and analysis of land use / land cover (LULC) dynamics is presented. The framework includes: (1) harmonization and preprocessing of high-resolution spatial and spatiotemporal covariate datasets (GLAD Landsat, NPP/VIIRS) including 5 million harmonized LUCAS and CORINE Land Cover-derived training samples, (2) model building based on spatial k-fold cross-validation and hyper-parameter optimization, (3) prediction of the most probable class, class probabilities and uncertainty per pixel, (4) LULC change analysis on time-series of produced maps. The spatiotemporal ensemble model was fitted by combining random forest, gradient boosted trees, and artificial neural network, with logistic regressor as meta-learner. The results show that the most important covariates for mapping LULC in Europe are: seasonal aggregates of Landsat green and near-infrared bands, multiple Landsat-derived spectral indices, and elevation. Spatial cross-validation of the model indicates consistent performance across multiple years with 62\%, 70\%, and 87\% accuracy when predicting 33 (level-3), 14 (level-2), and 5 classes (level-1); with artificial surface classes such as 'airports' and 'railroads' showing the lowest match with validation points. The spatiotemporal model outperforms spatial models on known-year classification by 2.7\% and unknown-year classification by 3.5\%. Results of the accuracy assessment using 48,365 independent test samples shows 87\% match with the validation points. Results of time-series analysis (time-series of LULC probabilities and NDVI images) suggest gradual deforestation trends in large parts of Sweden, the Alps, and Scotland. An advantage of using spatiotemporal ML is that the fitted model can be used to predict LULC in years that were not included in its training dataset, allowing generalization to past and future periods, e.g. to predict land cover for years prior to 2000 and beyond 2020. The generated land cover time-series data stack (ODSE-LULC), including the training points, is publicly available via the Open Data Science (ODS)-Europe Viewer.},

	abstract = {Up-to-date information about the Earth’s surface provided by land cover maps is essential for numerous environmental and land management applications. There is, therefore, a clear need for the continuous and reliable monitoring of land cover and land cover changes. The growing availability of high resolution, regularly collected remote sensing data can support the increasing number of applications that require high spatial resolution products that are frequently updated (e.g., annually). However, large-scale operational mapping requires a highly-automated data processing workﬂow, which is currently lacking. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for the automated classiﬁcation of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The method uses a random forest classiﬁer and existing land cover/use databases as the source of training samples. In order to demonstrate its operability, the method was implemented on a large part of the European continent, with CORINE Land Cover and High-Resolution Layers as training datasets. A land cover/use map for the year 2017 was produced, composed of 13 classes. An accuracy assessment, based on nearly 52,000 samples, revealed high thematic overall accuracy (86.1\%) on a continental scale, and average overall accuracy of 86.5\% at country level. Only low-frequency classes obtained lower accuracies and we recommend that their mapping should be improved in the future. Additional modiﬁcations to the classiﬁcation legend, notably the fusion of thematically and spectrally similar vegetation classes, increased overall accuracy to 89.0\%, and resulted in ten, general classes. A crucial aspect of the presented approach is that it embraces all of the most important elements of Earth observation data processing, enabling accurate and detailed (10 m spatial resolution) mapping with no manual user involvement. The presented methodology demonstrates possibility for frequent and repetitive operational production of large-scale land cover maps.},

Level 1 categories of the CLC2018 were analyzed in a 25 km × 25 km study area in Hungary. Spectral data were summarized by land cover polygons, and the dataset was evaluated with statistical tests. We then performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest classiﬁcations to reveal if CLC L1 level categories were conﬁrmed by spectral values. Wetlands and water bodies were the most likely to be confused with other categories. The least mixture was observed when we applied the median to quantify the pixel variance of CLC polygons. RF outperformed the LDA’s accuracy, and PlanetScope’s data were the most accurate. Analysis of class level accuracies showed that agricultural areas and wetlands had the most issues with misclassiﬁcation. We proved the representativeness of the results with a repeated randomized test, and only PlanetScope seemed to be ungeneralizable. Results showed that CLC polygons, as basic units of land cover, can ensure 71.1–78.5\% OAs for the three satellite sensors; higher geometric resolution resulted in better accuracy. These results justiﬁed CLC polygons, in spite of visual interpretation, can hold relevant information about land cover considering the surface reﬂectance values of satellites. However, using CLC as ground truth data for land cover classiﬁcations can be questionable, at least in the L1 nomenclature.},

	abstract = {Land cover classification has been widely investigated in remote sensing for agricultural, ecological and hydrological applications. Landsat images with multispectral bands are commonly used to study the numerous classification methods in order to improve the classification accuracy. Thermal remote sensing provides valuable information to investigate the effectiveness of the thermal bands in extracting land cover patterns. k-NN and Random Forest algorithms were applied to both the single Landsat 8 image and the time series Landsat 4/5 images for the Attert catchment in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, trained and validated by the ground-truth reference data considering the three level classification scheme from COoRdination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) using the 10-fold cross validation method. The accuracy assessment showed that compared to the visible and near infrared (VIS/NIR) bands, the time series of thermal images alone can produce comparatively reliable land cover maps with the best overall accuracy of 98.7\% to 99.1\% for Level 1 classification and 93.9\% to 96.3\% for the Level 2 classification. In addition, the combination with the thermal band improves the overall accuracy by 5\% and 6\% for the single Landsat 8 image in Level 2 and Level 3 category and provides the best classified results with all seven bands for the time series of Landsat TM images.},

In this study we compare the performance of diﬀerent remote-sensing feature combinations with and without the Landsat 8 thermal band (band 10). The results show that overall the thermal feature had a positive eﬀect on mapping land cover. A combination of spectral features, indices and the thermal feature maximized the improvement in accuracy. The proposed classiﬁer was applied to map land cover in an area in Egypt. The thermal feature signiﬁcantly reduced the confusion between cropland and wetland. The improvement in accuracy obtained by adding the thermal feature was analysed in a time series spanning 1 year. We found that the thermal feature improved the classiﬁcation accuracy when temperature variations occurred among the diﬀerent land-cover types. The eﬀect of the thermal feature was also inﬂuenced by the land cover; in cloudless conditions, warmer weather can enhance the accuracy improvement of the thermal feature.},

The study had an overall classification accuracy of 81.7\% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.722. The kappa coefficient is rated as substantial and hence the classified image found to be fit for further research.

The study targets the improvement of classification accuracy with the combined use of thermal and spectral information from satellite imagery. Land surface temperature (LST) is sensitive to land surface features and hence can be used to extract information on LULC features. The classification accuracy was found to improve on integrating the thermal information from the thermal band of Landsat ETM+ with spectral information. Two thermal vegetation indices, namely Thermal Integrated Vegetation Index (TLIVI) and Advanced Thermal Integrated Vegetation Index (ATLIVI), proposed in this study showed fairly good correlations (R2=0.65 and 0.7, respectively) with the derived surface temperature. These indices based on empirical parameterization of the relationship between surface temperature (Ts) and vegetation indices showed an increase of nearly 6\% in the overall accuracy for land-use/land-cover (LULC) classification in comparison to MLC algorithm using Standard False Colour Composite (FCC) satellite image of Landsat ETM+ as reference.},

Satellite imagery is the only data source with enough periodicity to provide consistent land cover information in a cost-effective way. The main aim of this paper is the creation of an operational framework for monitoring land cover dynamics based on Landsat imagery and open-source software. The methodology integrates the entire land cover and land cover change mapping processes to produce a consistent series of Land Cover maps. The consistency of the time series is achieved through the application of a single trained machine learning algorithm to radiometrically normalized imagery using iteratively re-weighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) across all dates of the historical period. As a result, seven individual Land Cover maps of Costa Rica were produced from 1985/1986 to 2013/2014. Post-classiﬁcation land cover change detection was performed to evaluate the land cover dynamics in Costa Rica. The validation of the land cover maps showed an overall accuracy of 87\% for the 2013/2014 map, 93\% for the 2000/2001 map and 89\% for the 1985/1986 map. Land cover changes between forest and non-forest classes were validated for the period between 2001 and 2011, obtaining an overall accuracy of 86\%. Forest age-classes were generated through a multi-temporal analysis of the maps. By linking deforestation dynamics with forest age, a more accurate discussion of the carbon emissions along the time series can be presented.},

	abstract = {Efﬁcient implementation of remote sensing image classiﬁcation can facilitate the extraction of spatiotemporal information for land use and land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation. Mapping LULC change can pave the way to investigate the impacts of different socioeconomic and environmental factors on the Earth’s surface. This study presents an algorithm that uses Landsat time-series data to analyze LULC change. We applied the Random Forest (RF) classiﬁer, a robust classiﬁcation method, in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 as inputs for the 1985 to 2019 period. We also explored the performance of the pan-sharpening algorithm on Landsat bands besides the impact of different image compositions to produce a high-quality LULC map. We used a statistical pan-sharpening algorithm to increase multispectral Landsat bands’ (Landsat 7–9) spatial resolution from 30 m to 15 m. In addition, we checked the impact of different image compositions based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data such as digital elevation model (DEM) and land surface temperature (LST) on ﬁnal classiﬁcation accuracy based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data on ﬁnal classiﬁcation accuracy. We compared the classiﬁcation result of our proposed method and the Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers (CGLCL) map to verify the algorithm. The results show that: (1) Using pan-sharpened top-of-atmosphere (TOA) Landsat products can produce more accurate results for classiﬁcation instead of using surface reﬂectance (SR) alone; (2) LST and DEM are essential features in classiﬁcation, and using them can increase ﬁnal accuracy; (3) the proposed algorithm produced higher accuracy (94.438\% overall accuracy (OA), 0.93 for Kappa, and 0.93 for F1-score) than CGLCL map (84.4\% OA, 0.79 for Kappa, and 0.50 for F1-score) in 2019; (4) the total agreement between the classiﬁcation results and the test data exceeds 90\% (93.37–97.6\%), 0.9 (0.91–0.96), and 0.85 (0.86–0.95) for OA, Kappa values, and F1-score, respectively, which is acceptable in both overall and Kappa accuracy. Moreover, we provide a code repository that allows classifying Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 within GEE. This method can be quickly and easily applied to other regions of interest for LULC mapping.},

	abstract = {For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift and regression kriging have become basic techniques that beneﬁt both from spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The ﬁrst case study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed stationary random ﬁelds with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily precipitation data for the 2016–2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies, RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting, random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp, particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution prediction maps were made.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

	abstract = {Identification of underground formation lithology from well log data is an important task in petroleum exploration and engineering. Recently, several computational algorithms have been used for lithology identification to improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we evaluate five typical machine learning methods, namely the Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting, for formation lithology identification using data from the Daniudui gas field and the Hangjinqi gas field. The input to each model consists of features selected from different well log data samples. To determine the best model to classify the lithology type, this study used validation curve to determine the parameter search range and adopted the hyper-parameter optimization method to obtain the best parameter set for each model. The performance of each classifier is also evaluated using 5-fold cross validation. The results suggest that ensemble methods are good algorithm choices for supervised classification of lithology using well log data. The Gradient Tree Boosting classifier is robust to overfitting because it grows trees sequentially by adjusting the weight of the training data distribution to minimize a loss function. The random forest classifier is also a suitable option. An evaluation matrix showed that the Gradient Tree Boosting and Random Forest classifiers have lower prediction errors compared with the other three models. Although all the models have difficulties in distinguishing sandstone classes, the Gradient Tree Boosting performs well on this task compared with the other four methods. Moreover, the classification accuracy is remarkably similar across the lithology classes for both the Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting models.},

This study investigated the accuracy of most popular ML models in the prediction of buildings heating and cooling loads carrying out speciﬁc tuning for each ML model and using two simulated building energy data generated in EnergyPlus and Ecotect and compared the results. The study used a grid-search coupled with cross-validation method to examine the combinations of model parameters. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis techniques were used to evaluate the importance of input variables on the performance of ML models. The accuracy and time complexity of models in predicting heating and cooling loads are demonstrated. Comparing the accuracy of the tuned models with the original research works reveals the signiﬁcant role of model optimisation. The outcomes of the sensitivity analysis are demonstrated as relative importance which resulted in the identiﬁcation of unimportant variables and faster model ﬁtting.},

Although several automatic optimization techniques exist, they have different strengths and drawbacks when applied to different types of problems.

We introduce several state-of-the-art optimization techniques and discuss how to apply them to machine learning algorithms. Many available libraries and frameworks developed for hyper-parameter optimization problems are provided, and some open challenges of hyper-parameter optimization research are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of different optimization methods and provide practical examples of hyper-parameter optimization.

	abstract = {While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial crossvalidation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47\%) between the bias-reduced (spatial crossvalidation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a uniﬁed framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identiﬁcation of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class uniﬁes six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this uniﬁcation, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Variable importance (VI) tools describe how much covariates contribute to a prediction model’s accuracy. However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model f (x) = xT β with a ﬁxed coeﬃcient vector β) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespeciﬁed class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of diﬀerent parametric forms, may ﬁt the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Speciﬁcally, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal eﬀects, and linear model coeﬃcients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.},

In this context, the Land Cover CCI (LC  CCI) project aims at building global land cover maps suitable for  climate modeling based on Earth observation by satellite sensors.  The   challenge  is  to  generate  a  set  of  successive  maps  that  are   both  accurate and consistent over time. To do so, operational methods  for the automated classiﬁcation of optical images are investigated. The  proposed approach consists of a locally trained classiﬁcation using an  automated selection of training samples from existing, but outdated land  cover information. Combinations of local extraction (based on spatial  criteria) and self-cleaning of training samples (based on spectral  criteria) are quantitatively assessed. Two large study areas, one in  Eurasia and the other in South America, are considered. The proposed  morphological cleaning of the training samples leads to higher  accuracies than the statistical outlier removal in the spectral domain.  An optimal neighborhood has been identiﬁed for the local sample  extraction. The results are coherent for the two test areas, showing an  improvement of the overall accuracy compared with the original reference  datasets and a signiﬁcant reduction of macroscopic errors. More  importantly, the proposed method partly controls the reliability of  existing land cover maps as sources of training samples for supervised  classiﬁcation.},

Remote sensing data are primary sources extensively used for change detection in recent decades. Many change detection techniques have been developed. This paper summarizes and reviews these techniques. Previous literature has shown that image differencing, principal component analysis and post-classiﬁcation comparison are the most common methods used for change detection. In recent years, spectral mixture analysis, artiﬁcial neural networks and integration of geographical information system and remote sensing data have become important techniques for change detection applications. Different change detection algorithms have their own merits and no single approach is optimal and applicable to all cases. In practice, different algorithms are often compared to ﬁnd the best change detection results for a speciﬁc application. Research of change detection techniques is still an active topic and new techniques are needed to effectively use the increasingly diverse and complex remotely sensed data available or projected to be soon available from satellite and airborne sensors.

	abstract = {Multiple satellite sensors are used to analyze physical processes that determine energy fluxes and their interaction at the urban surface. The study is based on summertime microclimate analyses of the Los Angeles and Paris metropolises. The method consists of deriving some parameters governing the surface heat fluxes, constructing statistics of thermal infrared images, and using a GIS to combine them with a landcover classification from SPOT-HRV multispectral images, and with data from intensive in-situ experiments. The average images reveal spatial and temporal variations of land surface temperature (LST), and distinct microclimatic patterns. The combined interpretation of the statistics images and of the landcover classification shows: (i) the effect of surface physical properties, especially in downtown business and industrial districts that display heat-islands larger than 7 jC; (ii) the temperating influence of water; (iii) the negative correlation between afternoon land surface temperature and normalized vegetation index, which confirms the cooling effect of urban parks; (iv) the correlation between variations of surface temperature and ozone concentration at diurnal and longer time scales.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface temperature (LST) – vegetation relationship. This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, USA, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thermal, and moisture properties of the Earth’s surface that determine LST.},

	abstract = {Many investigators need and use global land cover maps for a wide variety of purposes. Ironically, after many years of very limited availability, there are now multiple global land cover maps and it is not readily apparent (1) which is most useful for particular applications or (2) how to combine the different maps to provide an improved dataset. The existing global land cover maps at 1 km spatial resolution have arisen from different initiatives and are based on different remote sensing data and employed different methodologies. Perhaps more significantly, they have different legends. As a result, comparison of the different land cover maps is difficult and information about their relative utility is limited. In an attempt to compare the datasets and assess their strengths and weaknesses we harmonized the thematic legends of four available coarse-resolution global land cover maps (IGBP DISCover, UMD, MODIS 1-km, and GLC2000) using the LCCS-based land cover legend translation protocols. Analysis of the agreement among the global land cover maps and existing validation information highlights general patterns of agreement, inconsistencies and uncertainties. The thematic classes of Evergreen broadleaf trees, Snow and Ice, and Barren show high producer and user accuracy and good agreement among the datasets, while classes of mixed tree types show high commission errors. Overall, the results show a limited ability of the four global products to discriminate mixed classes characterized by a mosaic of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation. There is a strong relationship between class accuracy, spatial agreement among the datasets, and the heterogeneity of landscapes. Suggestions for future mapping projects include careful definition of mixed unit classes, and improvement in mapping heterogeneous landscapes.},

These techniques are especially useful for highly nonlinear relationship between the variables. In most studies the distance measure is adopted a priori. In contrast we propose a general procedure to find an adaptive metric that combines a local variance reducing technique and a linear embedding of the observation space into an appropriate Euclidean space. To illustrate the application of this technique, two agricultural land cover classifications using mono-temporal and multi-temporal Landsat scenes are presented. The results of the study, compared with standard approaches used in remote sensing such as maximum likelihood (ML) or k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) indicate substantial improvement with regard to the overall accuracy and the cardinality of the calibration data set. Also, using MNN in a soft/fuzzy classification framework demonstrated to be a very useful tool in order to derive critical areas that need some further attention and investment concerning additional calibration data.},

The Global Climate Observing System, set up under the auspices of United Nations organizations and the International Council for Science to help ensure the availability of systematic observations of climate, developed the concept of essential climate variables (ECVs). ECV data records are intended to provide reliable, traceable, observation-based evidence for a range of applications, including monitoring, mitigating, adapting to, and attributing climate changes, as well as the empirical basis required to understand past, current, and possible future climate variability. The ECV concept has been broadly adopted worldwide as the guiding basis for observing climate, including by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), WMO, and space agencies operating Earth observation satellites. This paper describes the rationale for these ECVs and their current selection, based on the principles of feasibility, relevance, and cost effectiveness. It also provides a view of how the ECV concept could evolve as a guide for rational and evidence-based monitoring of climate and environment. Selected examples are discussed to highlight the benefits, limitations, and future evolution of this approach. The article is intended to assist program managers to set priorities for climate observation, dataset generation and related research: for instance, within the emerging Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS). It also helps the observation community and individual researchers to contribute to systematic climate observation, by promoting understanding of ECV choices and the opportunities to influence their evolution.},

Greater Doha, which is a metropolis area where 78\% of the country’s population live, has witnessed a substantial population growth and a large urban expansion. This study is the first of its kind in the State of Qatar and it aims to provide an understanding of the land use/land cover (LULC) change and its spatio-temporal pattern in Greater Doha between the years 1997 and 2010. Parcel data and census statistics from these two dates were used in the analysis. LULC change statistics indicate a very large increase of 289\% in the built-up areas and a larger increase of 426\% of recreational spaces which shows a progressive planning approach towards improving living standards in Greater Doha. As a result of this development demands, the open spaces have been substantially reduced from 77\% to 25\%, population density increased in many parts of the metropolis and high-rise building started to dominate the skylines in certain parts of the metropolis. MARKOV model was used to generate future LULC change scenarios for the year 2020. The analysis predicts a 20\% increase of built-up areas which will take place in the open spaces, and this modest increase may be explained by model constraints resulting from limited availability of land within the current boundaries of Greater Doha for future development.},

In this study, LULC changes are investigated by using of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in Rize, North-East Turkey. For this purpose, firstly supervised classification technique is applied to Landsat images acquired in 1976 and 2000. Image Classification of six reflective bands of two Landsat images is carried out by using maximum likelihood method with the aid of ground truth data obtained from aerial images dated 1973 and 2002. The second part focused on land use land cover changes by using change detection comparison (pixel by pixel). In third part of the study, the land cover changes are analyzed according to the topographic structure (slope and altitude) by using GIS functions. The results indicate that severe land cover changes have occurred in agricultural (36.2\%) (especially in tea gardens), urban (117\%), pasture (-72.8\%) and forestry (-12.8\%) areas has been experienced in the region between 1976 and 2000. It was seen that the LULC changes were mostly occurred in coastal areas and in areas having low slope values.},

	abstract = {Rapid and uncontrolled population growth along with economic and industrial development, especially in developing countries during the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst centuries, have increased the rate of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change many times. Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is one of the most eﬃcient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of diﬀerent algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classiﬁer for further applications of earth observations. In this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Kappa coeﬃcient, receiver operational curve (RoC), index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa coeﬃcient show that all the classiﬁers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the MD algorithm (parametric classiﬁer) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised diﬀerentiation water index, normalised diﬀerentiation vegetation index and normalised diﬀerentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of signiﬁcance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classiﬁers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN and RF algorithms are the best LULC classiﬁers, although a non-parametric classiﬁer like SAM (Kappa coeﬃcient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best machine-learning LULC classiﬁer, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in diﬀerent morphoclimatic conditions in the future.},

Nevertheless, implementing a machine-learning classification is not straightforward, and the literature provides conflicting advice regarding many key issues. This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs. We illustrate these issues through applying machine-learning classification to two publically available remotely sensed data sets.},

	abstract = {Bare soil is a critical element in the urban landscape and plays an essential role in urban environments. Yet, the separation of bare soil and other land cover types using remote sensing techniques remains a significant challenge. There are several remote sensing-based spectral indices for barren detection, but their effectiveness varies depending on land cover patterns and climate conditions. Within this research, we introduced a modified bare soil index (MBI) using shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths derived from Landsat 8 (OLI—Operational Land Imager). The proposed bare soil index was tested in two different bare soil patterns in Thailand and Vietnam, where there are large areas of bare soil during the agricultural fallow period, obstructing the separation between bare soil and urban areas. Bare soil extracted from the MBI achieved higher overall accuracy of about 98\% and a kappa coefficient over 0.96, compared to bare soil index (BSI), normalized different bare soil index (NDBaI), and dry bare soil index (DBSI). The results also revealed that MBI considerably contributes to the accuracy of land cover classification. We suggest using the MBI for bare soil detection in tropical climatic regions.},

	abstract = {Vegetation indices and transformations have been used extensively in forest change detection studies. In this study, we processed multitemporal normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW) data sets and compared their statistical relationships and relative efficiencies in detecting forest disturbances associated with forest type and harvest intensity at five, two and one year Landsat acquisition intervals. The NDMI and TCW were highly correlated ({\textgreater}0.95 r2) for all five image dates. There was no significant difference between TCW and NDMI for detecting forest disturbance. Using either a NDMI or TCW image differencing method, when Landsat image acquisitions were 5 years apart, clear cuts could be detected with nearly equal accuracy compared to images collected 2 years apart. Partial cuts had much higher commission and omission errors compared to clear cut. Both methods had 7–8\% higher commission and 12–22\% higher omission error to detect hardwood disturbance when it occurred in the first year of the 2-year interval (as compared to 1-year interval). Softwood and hardwood change detection errors were slightly higher at 2-year Landsat acquisition intervals compared to 1-year interval. For images acquired 1 and 2 years apart, NDMI forest disturbance commission and omission errors were slightly lower than TCW. The NDMI can be calculated using any sensor that has near-infrared and shortwave bands and is at least as accurate as TCW for detecting forest type and intensity disturbance in biomes similar to the Maine forest, particularly when Landsat images are acquired less than 2 years apart. Where partial cutting is the most dominant harvesting system as is currently the case in northern Maine, we recommend images collected every year to minimize (particularly omission) errors. However, where clear cuts or nearly complete canopy removal occurs, Landsat intervals of up to 5 years may be nearly as accurate in detecting forest change as 1 or 2 year intervals.},

	abstract = {In situ collected spectrometer data were used to evaluate and quantify the relationships between various linear combinations of red and photographic infrared radiances and experimental plot biomass, leaf water content, and chlorophyll content. The radiance variables evaluated included the red and photographic infrared (IR) radiance and the linear combinations of the IR/red ratio, the square root of the IR/red ratio, the IR-red difference, the vegetation index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the IR and red linear combinations vis-à-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and IR linear combinations had 7\% and 14\% greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6\% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic IR radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies.},
