	abstract = {Abstract
          A seamless spatiotemporal machine learning framework for automated prediction, uncertainty assessment, and analysis of land use / land cover (LULC) dynamics is presented. The framework includes: (1) harmonization and preprocessing of high-resolution spatial and spatiotemporal covariate datasets (GLAD Landsat, NPP/VIIRS) including 5 million harmonized LUCAS and CORINE Land Cover-derived training samples, (2) model building based on spatial k-fold cross-validation and hyper-parameter optimization, (3) prediction of the most probable class, class probabilities and uncertainty per pixel, (4) LULC change analysis on time-series of produced maps. The spatiotemporal ensemble model was fitted by combining random forest, gradient boosted trees, and artificial neural network, with logistic regressor as meta-learner. The results show that the most important covariates for mapping LULC in Europe are: seasonal aggregates of Landsat green and near-infrared bands, multiple Landsat-derived spectral indices, and elevation. Spatial cross-validation of the model indicates consistent performance across multiple years with 62\%, 70\%, and 87\% accuracy when predicting 33 (level-3), 14 (level-2), and 5 classes (level-1); with artificial surface classes such as 'airports' and 'railroads' showing the lowest match with validation points. The spatiotemporal model outperforms spatial models on known-year classification by 2.7\% and unknown-year classification by 3.5\%. Results of the accuracy assessment using 48,365 independent test samples shows 87\% match with the validation points. Results of time-series analysis (time-series of LULC probabilities and NDVI images) suggest gradual deforestation trends in large parts of Sweden, the Alps, and Scotland. An advantage of using spatiotemporal ML is that the fitted model can be used to predict LULC in years that were not included in its training dataset, allowing generalization to past and future periods, e.g. to predict land cover for years prior to 2000 and beyond 2020. The generated land cover time-series data stack (ODSE-LULC), including the training points, is publicly available via the Open Data Science (ODS)-Europe Viewer.},

	abstract = {Up-to-date information about the Earth’s surface provided by land cover maps is essential for numerous environmental and land management applications. There is, therefore, a clear need for the continuous and reliable monitoring of land cover and land cover changes. The growing availability of high resolution, regularly collected remote sensing data can support the increasing number of applications that require high spatial resolution products that are frequently updated (e.g., annually). However, large-scale operational mapping requires a highly-automated data processing workﬂow, which is currently lacking. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for the automated classiﬁcation of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The method uses a random forest classiﬁer and existing land cover/use databases as the source of training samples. In order to demonstrate its operability, the method was implemented on a large part of the European continent, with CORINE Land Cover and High-Resolution Layers as training datasets. A land cover/use map for the year 2017 was produced, composed of 13 classes. An accuracy assessment, based on nearly 52,000 samples, revealed high thematic overall accuracy (86.1\%) on a continental scale, and average overall accuracy of 86.5\% at country level. Only low-frequency classes obtained lower accuracies and we recommend that their mapping should be improved in the future. Additional modiﬁcations to the classiﬁcation legend, notably the fusion of thematically and spectrally similar vegetation classes, increased overall accuracy to 89.0\%, and resulted in ten, general classes. A crucial aspect of the presented approach is that it embraces all of the most important elements of Earth observation data processing, enabling accurate and detailed (10 m spatial resolution) mapping with no manual user involvement. The presented methodology demonstrates possibility for frequent and repetitive operational production of large-scale land cover maps.},

Level 1 categories of the CLC2018 were analyzed in a 25 km × 25 km study area in Hungary. Spectral data were summarized by land cover polygons, and the dataset was evaluated with statistical tests. We then performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest classiﬁcations to reveal if CLC L1 level categories were conﬁrmed by spectral values. Wetlands and water bodies were the most likely to be confused with other categories. The least mixture was observed when we applied the median to quantify the pixel variance of CLC polygons. RF outperformed the LDA’s accuracy, and PlanetScope’s data were the most accurate. Analysis of class level accuracies showed that agricultural areas and wetlands had the most issues with misclassiﬁcation. We proved the representativeness of the results with a repeated randomized test, and only PlanetScope seemed to be ungeneralizable. Results showed that CLC polygons, as basic units of land cover, can ensure 71.1–78.5\% OAs for the three satellite sensors; higher geometric resolution resulted in better accuracy. These results justiﬁed CLC polygons, in spite of visual interpretation, can hold relevant information about land cover considering the surface reﬂectance values of satellites. However, using CLC as ground truth data for land cover classiﬁcations can be questionable, at least in the L1 nomenclature.},

	abstract = {Land cover classification has been widely investigated in remote sensing for agricultural, ecological and hydrological applications. Landsat images with multispectral bands are commonly used to study the numerous classification methods in order to improve the classification accuracy. Thermal remote sensing provides valuable information to investigate the effectiveness of the thermal bands in extracting land cover patterns. k-NN and Random Forest algorithms were applied to both the single Landsat 8 image and the time series Landsat 4/5 images for the Attert catchment in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, trained and validated by the ground-truth reference data considering the three level classification scheme from COoRdination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) using the 10-fold cross validation method. The accuracy assessment showed that compared to the visible and near infrared (VIS/NIR) bands, the time series of thermal images alone can produce comparatively reliable land cover maps with the best overall accuracy of 98.7\% to 99.1\% for Level 1 classification and 93.9\% to 96.3\% for the Level 2 classification. In addition, the combination with the thermal band improves the overall accuracy by 5\% and 6\% for the single Landsat 8 image in Level 2 and Level 3 category and provides the best classified results with all seven bands for the time series of Landsat TM images.},

In this study we compare the performance of diﬀerent remote-sensing feature combinations with and without the Landsat 8 thermal band (band 10). The results show that overall the thermal feature had a positive eﬀect on mapping land cover. A combination of spectral features, indices and the thermal feature maximized the improvement in accuracy. The proposed classiﬁer was applied to map land cover in an area in Egypt. The thermal feature signiﬁcantly reduced the confusion between cropland and wetland. The improvement in accuracy obtained by adding the thermal feature was analysed in a time series spanning 1 year. We found that the thermal feature improved the classiﬁcation accuracy when temperature variations occurred among the diﬀerent land-cover types. The eﬀect of the thermal feature was also inﬂuenced by the land cover; in cloudless conditions, warmer weather can enhance the accuracy improvement of the thermal feature.},

The study had an overall classification accuracy of 81.7\% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.722. The kappa coefficient is rated as substantial and hence the classified image found to be fit for further research.

The study targets the improvement of classification accuracy with the combined use of thermal and spectral information from satellite imagery. Land surface temperature (LST) is sensitive to land surface features and hence can be used to extract information on LULC features. The classification accuracy was found to improve on integrating the thermal information from the thermal band of Landsat ETM+ with spectral information. Two thermal vegetation indices, namely Thermal Integrated Vegetation Index (TLIVI) and Advanced Thermal Integrated Vegetation Index (ATLIVI), proposed in this study showed fairly good correlations (R2=0.65 and 0.7, respectively) with the derived surface temperature. These indices based on empirical parameterization of the relationship between surface temperature (Ts) and vegetation indices showed an increase of nearly 6\% in the overall accuracy for land-use/land-cover (LULC) classification in comparison to MLC algorithm using Standard False Colour Composite (FCC) satellite image of Landsat ETM+ as reference.},

Satellite imagery is the only data source with enough periodicity to provide consistent land cover information in a cost-effective way. The main aim of this paper is the creation of an operational framework for monitoring land cover dynamics based on Landsat imagery and open-source software. The methodology integrates the entire land cover and land cover change mapping processes to produce a consistent series of Land Cover maps. The consistency of the time series is achieved through the application of a single trained machine learning algorithm to radiometrically normalized imagery using iteratively re-weighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) across all dates of the historical period. As a result, seven individual Land Cover maps of Costa Rica were produced from 1985/1986 to 2013/2014. Post-classiﬁcation land cover change detection was performed to evaluate the land cover dynamics in Costa Rica. The validation of the land cover maps showed an overall accuracy of 87\% for the 2013/2014 map, 93\% for the 2000/2001 map and 89\% for the 1985/1986 map. Land cover changes between forest and non-forest classes were validated for the period between 2001 and 2011, obtaining an overall accuracy of 86\%. Forest age-classes were generated through a multi-temporal analysis of the maps. By linking deforestation dynamics with forest age, a more accurate discussion of the carbon emissions along the time series can be presented.},

	abstract = {Efﬁcient implementation of remote sensing image classiﬁcation can facilitate the extraction of spatiotemporal information for land use and land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation. Mapping LULC change can pave the way to investigate the impacts of different socioeconomic and environmental factors on the Earth’s surface. This study presents an algorithm that uses Landsat time-series data to analyze LULC change. We applied the Random Forest (RF) classiﬁer, a robust classiﬁcation method, in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 as inputs for the 1985 to 2019 period. We also explored the performance of the pan-sharpening algorithm on Landsat bands besides the impact of different image compositions to produce a high-quality LULC map. We used a statistical pan-sharpening algorithm to increase multispectral Landsat bands’ (Landsat 7–9) spatial resolution from 30 m to 15 m. In addition, we checked the impact of different image compositions based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data such as digital elevation model (DEM) and land surface temperature (LST) on ﬁnal classiﬁcation accuracy based on several spectral indices and other auxiliary data on ﬁnal classiﬁcation accuracy. We compared the classiﬁcation result of our proposed method and the Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers (CGLCL) map to verify the algorithm. The results show that: (1) Using pan-sharpened top-of-atmosphere (TOA) Landsat products can produce more accurate results for classiﬁcation instead of using surface reﬂectance (SR) alone; (2) LST and DEM are essential features in classiﬁcation, and using them can increase ﬁnal accuracy; (3) the proposed algorithm produced higher accuracy (94.438\% overall accuracy (OA), 0.93 for Kappa, and 0.93 for F1-score) than CGLCL map (84.4\% OA, 0.79 for Kappa, and 0.50 for F1-score) in 2019; (4) the total agreement between the classiﬁcation results and the test data exceeds 90\% (93.37–97.6\%), 0.9 (0.91–0.96), and 0.85 (0.86–0.95) for OA, Kappa values, and F1-score, respectively, which is acceptable in both overall and Kappa accuracy. Moreover, we provide a code repository that allows classifying Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 within GEE. This method can be quickly and easily applied to other regions of interest for LULC mapping.},

	abstract = {In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart and automated applications, the knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning (ML) is the key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals as well as for decision-makers in various real-world situations and application areas, particularly from the technical point of view.},

	abstract = {For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift and regression kriging have become basic techniques that beneﬁt both from spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The ﬁrst case study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed stationary random ﬁelds with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily precipitation data for the 2016–2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies, RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting, random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp, particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution prediction maps were made.},
