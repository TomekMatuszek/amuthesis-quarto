# Evaluating thermal band's impact {#sec-results-therm}

As described in [@sec-importance], variable importance can be assessed both on dataset and instance (observation) level.
The latter was used to estimate spatial distribution of thermal band's importance in order to present the results on the map.

However, before moving to thermal band's importance assessment, I explored Landsat dataset more carefully in order to determine correlated variables and interactions between them ([@fig-rycina19]).
Creating correlation plot ([@fig-rycina19]) revealed that some bands are highly correlated - especially these from visible spectrum and SWIR bands.
This may suggest that these variables depend on the other variable's values [@biecek_explanatory_2021], thus absence of one variable might not lower model's performance because other variable can fill this information gap.
On the other hand, feature selection performed with the help of *mlr3* framework [@R-mlr3] has shown that including all variables still proves to achieve the best model performance.
Moreover, implemented methods of assessing variable importance (described in [@sec-importance]) are designed to minimize impact of interactions between variables.

<!--In addition, differences between land cover classes in terms of thermal band's value were investigated.
@fig-rycina19a shows that land surface temperature (LST) can help to distinguish some land cover classes from others.
On the other hand, there are similarities between pairs of land cover types, for example bare land and artificial land.

## Measuring importance of thermal band {#sec-imp-overall}

As a very basic way to check thermal band's importance on model results, I implemented benchmarking methods with the help of functions provided by *mlr3* framework [@R-mlr3].
Two datasets (*tasks*) were created: one with thermal band included and one without this variable.
Other hyperparameters of models were the same.
Then, 5-fold spatial cross-validation with 10 repetitions were performed on models created from both datasets in order to estimate their predictive abilities.
Differences between them were very narrow, but visible - model with thermal band included achieved higher average accuracy of approximately 0.4 perc. points and higher average Kappa of approx. 0.006.
Moreover, distribution of accuracy values in the boxplot changed visibly, with higher median accuracy for model with thermal band included ([@fig-rycina12]).
In the end, however, these differences are rather small and we can not state that thermal band had strong impact on model predictions.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rycina12
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Accuracy distributions for 50 models with and without thermal band included"
#| out-width: "540px"
#| out-height: 300px
knitr::include_graphics("figures/model_comparison.png")
```

In the next step of thermal information importance evaluation, overall measures were derived.
Again, it turned out that thermal band variable had little impact on the model results.
With cross-entropy loss value of 28, it was the least important variable in the dataset.
Importance values of all variables are shown in [@fig-rycina13].

```{r}
#| label: fig-rycina13
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Overall variable importance expressed as cross-entropy loss"
#| out-width: "540px"
#| out-height: 300px
knitr::include_graphics("figures/importance.png")
```

After evaluating variable importance on dataset level, instance level calculations were performed.
Shapley values for each of 166 LUCAS points in Poznań metropolitan area were computed and thermal band's importance was derived.
This made possible to calculate average thermal band's importance for each of seven land cover classes.
In addition, mean value of temperature for each class was computed in order to give better insight into differences between them.
Results of these computations are shown in [@tbl-tabela6].
However, it must be emphasized that 166 points was rather small number, especially for less numerous classes such as wetlands.

[@tbl-tabela6] presents differences of thermal band's importance across land cover types.
It was significantly higher for artificial land and wetlands.
Average value for wetlands is not very reliable though, because there were only 3 such points in studied area - one of them having much higher value of importance than the other two.
Due to this issue, median value of importance was calculated too.
In this case, value for wetlands was much lower, but importance value for artificial areas was nearly the same.
Distributions of importance values can be examined in larger detail in [@fig-rycina14].

```{r tabela3, echo=FALSE}

df = data.frame(
  class = c("arable land", "grasslands", "forests", "bare land", "artificial land", "water bodies", "wetlands"),
  value = c(20.5, 20.5, 16.0, 21.1, 21.9, 13.8, 15.0),
  mean_imp = c(0.022, 0.02, 0.022, 0.019, 0.046, 0.008, 0.049),
  median_imp = c(0.019, 0.016, 0.019, 0.019, 0.046, 0.008, 0.016)
)
colnames(df) = c("Land cover class", "Mean temp. [°C]", "Average importance", "Median importance")

```

```

In addition, mean importance values for every land cover class are shown in @fig-rycina14a.
With the help of this chart, some comparisons between land cover classes and variables can be made.
Thermal band's importance for prediction of artificial land turns out not to be the highest among other variables.
Some bands have higher influence on predicting this land cover type.
On the other hand, thermal band is one of five bands, whose impact for predicting artificial land was higher than the average.

#| out-width: "537px"
#| out-height: 300px

```

In the last step of evaluating thermal band's importance for the model, I created partial-dependence (PD) profiles for this variable ([@fig-rycina15]) and compared it with PD profile for near-infrared band (B5) presented in [@fig-rycina16].
Thanks to PD plots, I checked how probability for choosing certain class changed with increasing values of analysed variables while keeping other features at their average values.
Probabilities do not drastically change with temperature (thermal band's value) increase, there are only small fluctuations for several classes.
This allows us to conclude that thermal band might not have significant impact on model results.
In contrast, B5 variable profile has clearly visible fluctuations for nearly every class ([@fig-rycina16]).
Probabilities change significantly along with changes of near-infrared values, thus suggesting that this variable has greater impact on the model predictions than thermal band.

```

## Spatial distribution of thermal band's importance {#sec-imp-spat}

Variable importance values computed for LUCAS points in [@sec-imp-overall] were used to interpolate them into continuous raster layer using IDW interpolation method.
This step created an opportunity to examine approximate spatial distribution of thermal band's importance across Poznań metropolitan area ([@fig-rycina17]).

```{r}
#| label: fig-rycina17
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Thermal band importance interpolated from values on LUCAS points locations"
#| out-width: "564px"
#| out-height: 400px
knitr::include_graphics("figures/B10_importance-spatial-ENG.png")
```

Moreover, alternative approach involving raster aggregation was also implemented.
In this method, original satellite data was aggregated (resampled) to 1,5 km resolution in order to make analysis more general and to shorten the computation time.
After aggregation, thermal band's importance was calculated for every raster cell.
Result of these calculations, as well as aggregated raster in RGB composition, are shown in [@fig-rycina18].
In general, there is similar distribution of thermal band's importance like in [@fig-rycina17], however this approach does not require interpolation of values from points which may be misleading, especially in places far away from LUCAS points.
On the other hand, spectral values were averaged for every 1,5 km cell so these mean values may not represent accurately features on the ground.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rycina18
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Thermal band importance calculated for raster cells aggregated to 1,5 km resolution. Small map in right-bottom corner shows averaged spectral values in RGB composition."
#| out-width: "564px"
#| out-height: 400px
knitr::include_graphics("figures/B10_importance-spatial-ENG2.png")
```

Correlation of thermal band's importance with artificial land class is visible on both maps.
In each case, high importance values are concentrated mainly in urban areas, especially in Poznań as it is the biggest city in the study area.
Also in smaller towns there is a higher thermal band's impact on model results, but because of their size, it is often harder to detect.
