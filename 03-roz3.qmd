# Methods {#sec-methods}

Workflow of our study consisted of several stages: preprocessing source data (described in Chapter [-@sec-data]), creating training dataset, model's parameters tuning, land cover map prediction, model quality assessment and evaluating the impact of thermal band on model's results.
Every of these steps was performed using R programming language [@R-base].
Final visualisations were created in QGIS software [@QGIS_software].
Both programming environment and GIS software used in this process are open-source.

## Machine learning {#sec-ml}

Machine learning is a computation method used to teach machines to learn from datasets in order to handle the data more efficiently and enhance from experience automatically without being specifically programmed [@mahesh_machine_2018] [@sarker_machine_2021].
We can divide machine learning into two main groups: supervised and unsupervised.

Unsupervised learning analyzes unlabeled datasets without the need for human intervention.
This is widely used for extracting generative features, identifying meaningful trends and structures, groupings in results, and exploratory purposes. [@sarker_machine_2021]
This type of machine learning discovers hidden patterns or data groupings (clusters) which is used in exploratory analysis or objects segmentation.
The most common unsupervised learning algorithm is clustering.

Supervised learning uses labeled training data and a collection of training examples which are used by algorithm to find relationships and functions between different variables used to describe training data.
It is carried out when certain goals are identified to be accomplished from a certain set of inputs.
There are two types of supervised learning tasks: classification (seperating data) and regression (fitting data). [@sarker_machine_2021]

In this study, supervised classification algorithm called Random Forest was used.
