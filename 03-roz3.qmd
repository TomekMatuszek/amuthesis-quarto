# Land cover map {#sec-results-map}

The main product of created model is a land cover map of Poznań metropolitan area ([@fig-rycina9]).
Moreover, created model contains probabilities of choosing each class for every pixel of the raster layer.
With the help of this information, a probability map showing model's confidence in its choice of land cover class was created ([@fig-rycina11]).
Value of each pixel reflects the highest probability assigned to one of seven land cover classes.

After a visual analysis of @fig-rycina9, some conclusions about its general accuracy can be made.
Overall distributions of main land cover classes such as urban areas (artificial land), forests, arable land and waterbodies, seem to be correctly recognized.

In order to investigate model's predictive accuracy on a local scale, six arbitrary chosen sites were examined more closely ([@fig-rycina10]).
Locations of sites were chosen to present different landscape patterns on the studied map, as well as point out more common mistakes made by the model.
Visual analysis of these sites showed that the model correctly recognizes most of land cover patterns present on the ground.
At the same time, there were several bigger problems and mistakes in its predictions.
For instance, there are many examples of single pixels in the artificial area being classified as arable land (especially in sites 1, 2 and 6).
Urban areas are generally more fragmented on the created map than in reality.
Moreover, some cropland areas were incorrectly classified as grassland (sites 4, 5 and 6).
Another problem occurred in the classification of a river surface - its shape on the land cover map was not continuous and water was often misclassified as wetland (sites 1 and 5).
On the other hand, the model has managed to correctly recognize wetlands in sites 2 and 4, despite the fact that no training point of wetlands class was located nearby.

Analysis of the model's confidence derived from the probability map ([@fig-rycina11]) showed visible spatial autocorrelation.
In order to derive mean values of confidence for every land cover class, zonal statistics were calculated.
Highest values of confidence were recorded for forests (0.86) and waterbodies (0.92).
For urban areas and arable land, model's confidence was lower at mean level of 0.64 and 0.71, respectively.
The model was least confident in recognizing bare land (0.44), wetlands (0.46) and grassland (0.57).
