# Result land cover map {#sec-results-map}

Main product of created model is land cover map of Poznań metropolitan area ([@fig-rycina9]).
Moreover, model calculated probabilities of choosing each class for every pixel of raster layer.
With the help of this information, probability map showing model's confidence in its choice of land cover class was created ([@fig-rycina11]).
Value of each pixel reflects the highest probability assigned to one of seven land cover classes, which was the output class chosen by the model.

After a visual analysis of result map in @fig-rycina9, some conclusions about its general accuracy can be made.
Overall distributions of main land cover classes such as urban areas (artificial land), forests, arable land and waterbodies, seem to be correctly recognized.

Analysis of model's confidence derived from probability map ([@fig-rycina11]) showed visible spatial autocorrelation of this measure.
In order to derive mean values of confidence for every land cover class, zonal statistics were calculated.
Highest values of confidence were recorded for forests (0.86) and waterbodies (0.92).
As of urban areas and arable land, model's confidence was lower at mean level of 0.64 and 0.71 respectively.
The model was least confident in recognizing bare land (0.44), wetlands (0.46) and grassland (0.57).
