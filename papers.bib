	abstract = {Abstract
          A seamless spatiotemporal machine learning framework for automated prediction, uncertainty assessment, and analysis of land use / land cover (LULC) dynamics is presented. The framework includes: (1) harmonization and preprocessing of high-resolution spatial and spatiotemporal covariate datasets (GLAD Landsat, NPP/VIIRS) including 5 million harmonized LUCAS and CORINE Land Cover-derived training samples, (2) model building based on spatial k-fold cross-validation and hyper-parameter optimization, (3) prediction of the most probable class, class probabilities and uncertainty per pixel, (4) LULC change analysis on time-series of produced maps. The spatiotemporal ensemble model was fitted by combining random forest, gradient boosted trees, and artificial neural network, with logistic regressor as meta-learner. The results show that the most important covariates for mapping LULC in Europe are: seasonal aggregates of Landsat green and near-infrared bands, multiple Landsat-derived spectral indices, and elevation. Spatial cross-validation of the model indicates consistent performance across multiple years with 62\%, 70\%, and 87\% accuracy when predicting 33 (level-3), 14 (level-2), and 5 classes (level-1); with artificial surface classes such as 'airports' and 'railroads' showing the lowest match with validation points. The spatiotemporal model outperforms spatial models on known-year classification by 2.7\% and unknown-year classification by 3.5\%. Results of the accuracy assessment using 48,365 independent test samples shows 87\% match with the validation points. Results of time-series analysis (time-series of LULC probabilities and NDVI images) suggest gradual deforestation trends in large parts of Sweden, the Alps, and Scotland. An advantage of using spatiotemporal ML is that the fitted model can be used to predict LULC in years that were not included in its training dataset, allowing generalization to past and future periods, e.g. to predict land cover for years prior to 2000 and beyond 2020. The generated land cover time-series data stack (ODSE-LULC), including the training points, is publicly available via the Open Data Science (ODS)-Europe Viewer.},

	abstract = {Up-to-date information about the Earth’s surface provided by land cover maps is essential for numerous environmental and land management applications. There is, therefore, a clear need for the continuous and reliable monitoring of land cover and land cover changes. The growing availability of high resolution, regularly collected remote sensing data can support the increasing number of applications that require high spatial resolution products that are frequently updated (e.g., annually). However, large-scale operational mapping requires a highly-automated data processing workﬂow, which is currently lacking. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for the automated classiﬁcation of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The method uses a random forest classiﬁer and existing land cover/use databases as the source of training samples. In order to demonstrate its operability, the method was implemented on a large part of the European continent, with CORINE Land Cover and High-Resolution Layers as training datasets. A land cover/use map for the year 2017 was produced, composed of 13 classes. An accuracy assessment, based on nearly 52,000 samples, revealed high thematic overall accuracy (86.1\%) on a continental scale, and average overall accuracy of 86.5\% at country level. Only low-frequency classes obtained lower accuracies and we recommend that their mapping should be improved in the future. Additional modiﬁcations to the classiﬁcation legend, notably the fusion of thematically and spectrally similar vegetation classes, increased overall accuracy to 89.0\%, and resulted in ten, general classes. A crucial aspect of the presented approach is that it embraces all of the most important elements of Earth observation data processing, enabling accurate and detailed (10 m spatial resolution) mapping with no manual user involvement. The presented methodology demonstrates possibility for frequent and repetitive operational production of large-scale land cover maps.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the Corine Land Cover 2018 (CLC2018) dataset to reveal the correspondence between land cover categories of the CLC and the spectral information of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images. Level 1 categories of the CLC2018 were analyzed in a 25 km × 25 km study area in Hungary. Spectral data were summarized by land cover polygons, and the dataset was evaluated with statistical tests. We then performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest classiﬁcations to reveal if CLC L1 level categories were conﬁrmed by spectral values. Wetlands and water bodies were the most likely to be confused with other categories. The least mixture was observed when we applied the median to quantify the pixel variance of CLC polygons. RF outperformed the LDA’s accuracy, and PlanetScope’s data were the most accurate. Analysis of class level accuracies showed that agricultural areas and wetlands had the most issues with misclassiﬁcation. We proved the representativeness of the results with a repeated randomized test, and only PlanetScope seemed to be ungeneralizable. Results showed that CLC polygons, as basic units of land cover, can ensure 71.1–78.5\% OAs for the three satellite sensors; higher geometric resolution resulted in better accuracy. These results justiﬁed CLC polygons, in spite of visual interpretation, can hold relevant information about land cover considering the surface reﬂectance values of satellites. However, using CLC as ground truth data for land cover classiﬁcations can be questionable, at least in the L1 nomenclature.},

	abstract = {Land cover classification has been widely investigated in remote sensing for agricultural, ecological and hydrological applications. Landsat images with multispectral bands are commonly used to study the numerous classification methods in order to improve the classification accuracy. Thermal remote sensing provides valuable information to investigate the effectiveness of the thermal bands in extracting land cover patterns. k-NN and Random Forest algorithms were applied to both the single Landsat 8 image and the time series Landsat 4/5 images for the Attert catchment in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, trained and validated by the ground-truth reference data considering the three level classification scheme from COoRdination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) using the 10-fold cross validation method. The accuracy assessment showed that compared to the visible and near infrared (VIS/NIR) bands, the time series of thermal images alone can produce comparatively reliable land cover maps with the best overall accuracy of 98.7\% to 99.1\% for Level 1 classification and 93.9\% to 96.3\% for the Level 2 classification. In addition, the combination with the thermal band improves the overall accuracy by 5\% and 6\% for the single Landsat 8 image in Level 2 and Level 3 category and provides the best classified results with all seven bands for the time series of Landsat TM images.},

However, thermal data, which can provide auxiliary information, is often ignored in land-cover classiﬁcation. In this study we compare the performance of diﬀerent remote-sensing feature combinations with and without the Landsat 8 thermal band (band 10). The results show that overall the thermal feature had a positive eﬀect on mapping land cover. A combination of spectral features, indices and the thermal feature maximized the improvement in accuracy. The proposed classiﬁer was applied to map land cover in an area in Egypt. The thermal feature signiﬁcantly reduced the confusion between cropland and wetland. The improvement in accuracy obtained by adding the thermal feature was analysed in a time series spanning 1 year. We found that the thermal feature improved the classiﬁcation accuracy when temperature variations occurred among the diﬀerent land-cover types. The eﬀect of the thermal feature was also inﬂuenced by the land cover; in cloudless conditions, warmer weather can enhance the accuracy improvement of the thermal feature.},

The objective of this research was to classify and map land-use/land-cover of the study area using remote sensing and Geospatial Information System (GIS) techniques. This research includes two sections (1) Landuse/Landcover (LULC) classification and (2) accuracy assessment. In this study supervised classification was performed using Non Parametric Rule. The major LULC classified were agriculture (65.0\%), water body (4.0\%), and built up areas (18.3\%), mixed forest (5.2\%), shrubs (7.0\%), and Barren/bare land (0.5\%). The study had an overall classification accuracy of 81.7\% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.722. The kappa coefficient is rated as substantial and hence the classified image found to be fit for further research.
